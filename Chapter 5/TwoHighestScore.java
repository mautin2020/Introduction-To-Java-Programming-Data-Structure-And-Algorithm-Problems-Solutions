/**5.9 (Find the two highest scores) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
        number of students and each studentâ€™s name and score, and finally displays the
        student with the highest score and the student with the second-highest score. Use
        the next() method in the Scanner class to read a name rather than using the
        nextLine() method. Assume that the number of students is at least 2.
